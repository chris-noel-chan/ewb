				<span>Question:</span>
				<h2>Who are you?</h2>
				<span>Answer:</span>
				<p>Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! Fun and failure both start out the same way. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold.</p>
				<p>And THAT'S why you always leave a note. I'm foolish and I'm funny and I'm needy. Am I needy? Are you sure I'm not needy? 'Cause I feel needy sometimes. This is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. I cheated and I lied and I whored around. He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same.</p>

				<span>Question:</span>
				<h2>Who do you work for?</h2>
				<span>Answer:</span>
				<p>I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. It's a gaming ship. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. I made a huge tiny mistake. Fried cheese… with club sauce. NO TOUCHING! No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me. Well, they got the Asian right… "hotties" might be a stretch.</p>
				<p>Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. Annyong. Daddy horny, Michael. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. And the soup of the day is bread.</p>

			<article id="whatneed" class="o-box">
				<span>Question:</span>
				<h2>What do they need?</h2>
				<span>Answer:</span>
				<p>You were just a turd out there, you know? You couldn't kick, and you couldn't run, you know? You were just a turd. What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? I've been in the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get one in the can. Tobias Fünke costume. I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat. I just bought you a f**king pizza. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror.</p>

				<span>Question:</span>
				<h2>How do you help them?</h2>
				<span>Answer:</span>
				<p>I hear the jury's still out on science. I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast. Mission Accomplished. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits.</p>
				<p>There's a girl in my soup! ♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it.</p>
				<p>Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth. Wine only turns to alcohol if you let it sit.</p>

			<h2>Thank you!</h2>
			<p>It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time. I [bleeped] the business model. Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'.</p>
			<p>You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. Say something that will terrify me. Lindsay: F*** me. Tobias: No, that didn't do it. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's left of your uncle. Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk!</p>
